Project Overview

The Travel and Tourism Management System is a web-based application that provides a platform for managing travel bookings, customers, tour packages, payment transactions, and administrative tasks.

The system is divided into different modules to handle the following:

- User Module: Allow users to browse and book travel packages, view details, and manage their profiles.
- Admin Module: Enable administrators to add and manage tour packages, view bookings, and handle customer queries.
- Database Management: Use JDBC for database interaction and data management, ensuring smooth operation of the application.

This system provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to explore travel options and for admins to manage the system effectively.

Technologies Used

- Java: The core programming language for the application logic.
- Maven: For dependency management and build automation.
- JSP (JavaServer Pages): For dynamic page generation on the server side.
- JDBC (Java Database Connectivity): For connecting and interacting with the database.
- HTML: For structuring the web pages.
- CSS: For styling the web pages.
- JavaScript: For client-side interactivity and functionality.
- MySQL: As the relational database to store data.

Features

- User Registration & Login: Users can register, log in, and manage their profiles.
- Tour Packages: Display various travel packages with details like destination, price, and availability.
- Booking System: Users can select and book tour packages based on their preferences.
- Admin Panel: Admins can manage users, packages, bookings, and view customer feedback.
- Payment Integration: Simulate a payment gateway to handle transactions.
- Search & Filter: Users can search for specific tour packages based on different criteria (e.g., destination, price range).
- Booking History: Users can view their past bookings.

System Requirements

- JDK 8 or above: Java Development Kit for compiling and running the application.
- Apache Tomcat 9.0+: For running the web application.
- Maven: For dependency management and building the project.
- MySQL: For database storage.
- Web Browser: Chrome, Firefox, or any modern browser to access the application.
